# odin-recipes
Repo for my Odin Recipe project, according to the instructions laid out [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). 
My recipes were Kare Kare, Adobo, and Filipino Spaghetti. I took some liberty in naming some headings, as well as adding links at the bottom 
of each recipe that show where I got the recipe description, ingredients, recipe instruction, and the picture of the dish.

First edit: added some CSS according to instructions [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-block-and-inline).

The project is accesible via this link: https://dashikibulbasaur.github.io/odin-recipes/
