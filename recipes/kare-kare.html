  <h2>What is Kare Kare?</h2>
  <p id="introduction">
    Kare-Kare is a classic Filipino stew with tender oxtail (or beef) and vegetables in a rich peanut sauce.

    </ul>

  <h2>How to cook Kare Kare</h2>
  <div class="list-container">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to boil and blanch the oxtail and beef chunks plus the tripe until
        they change color and the scum rises to the top roughly 5 minutes. Remove the beef parts,
        rinse quickly in cold water then set aside to drain. This is done to remove impurities from the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil on medium heat in a deep pan. Saute the garlic and shallots until aromatic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the meat and tripe. Stir then cover. Allow the meat to sweat or render its
        fat for about 5-10 minutes. Check the meat halfway through. Pour enough boiling
        water to cover the meat. Add the fish sauce and freshly ground pepper to season
        the beef and broth. You can also add 2 Knorr beef cubes or beef bouillon to the
        water for extra flavor (especially if you don’t have fish sauce). Cook until beef
        is tender about 1-1 1/2 hours. A pressure cooker may be used to shorten the time
        of tenderizing the beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, extract the color from the anatto seeds by immersing
        them in boiling water. Stir. Strain the seeds and set aside the red-colored liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the meat is tender, add the banana flowers or banana blossoms
        and the peanut butter. Stir to ensure the peanut butter melts into
        the sauce. Add the rest of the vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the red liquid from the annatto seeds. Add just enough liquid
        to turn the sauce into a deep yellow or mustardy color. Continue
        to cook just until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. Taste
        and season lightly, if desired or needed. (Don’t make it too salty
        because it will be served with a salty condiment on the side).
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly blanch the bok choy in boiling water to allow it to wilt.
        Transfer the stew to a serving bowl then add the blanched bok choy
        on top. Serve on the side with shrimp paste or bagoong alamang.
        Drizzle the sauce over rice!
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>NOTE:</b> If the sauce is not thick enough to your liking simply
        you may thicken it with a little cornstarch diluted with water.
      </li>
    </ol>
